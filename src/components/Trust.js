        <h3>Completeness &amp; Accuracy of Our Data</h3>
        <p>
            We aim to have 100% complete &amp; accurate lists of requirements for closing escrow in every city in California. We source our data from trusted local agents, Disclosures And Disclaimers Advisories published by realtors' associations, and hundreds of city, county &amp; agency websites which we crawl daily to check for updates.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, regulations are constantly changing, and if you come across any inaccuracies, <a href="/">we'd love to hear from you</a>.
