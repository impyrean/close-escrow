        article: independently shareable, so nothing for now
        main: top-level
        summary: req header
        details: req card
        footer
    main, article, section, footer, details, summary
    later: header, nav
- consider common content format:
    paragraphs: [{ html: "", type: "positive|warning|negative|info"}]
